# üîß Customizations in Matrix SDK (Zo Chat)

This project uses a custom Matrix SDK with additional support for Zo-specific features and event types.

## üì¶ Custom State Event Types
The following custom state event types have been added and are used within the `client.dart` file of the SDK:

| Event Type          | Description                                                             |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `zo.config`         | Carries client-side configuration or settings pushed from the server.   |
| `zo.ozone.banner`   | Used to manage banner image within rooms.                               |

## ‚úâÔ∏è Custom Parameters in sendTextEvent (Room.dart)
The `sendTextEvent` method in `Room.dart` has been extended with custom parameters to support advanced Zo Chat functionality.

* ‚úÖ Custom Parameters

| Parameter                     | Type      | Affects                     | Description                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `isWebSearchEnable`           | `bool`    | AI & search commands        | Activates web search processing (e.g., web-powered replies).                    |
| `isImageModeEnable`           | `bool`    | Media generation            | Enables image response or generation mode (e.g., prompts for DALL¬∑E or ZoDraw). |
| `isEchoChamber`               | `bool`    | Room behavior customization | Triggers behavior for private, self-looping message scenarios.                  |
| `echoChamberData`             | `String?` | Contextual processing       | Supplies extra data or options for the Echo Chamber scenario.                   |
| `isEchoSquad`                 | `bool`    | Group dynamics              | Supports enhanced group behaviors or multi-user response formats.               |
| `echoSquadData`               | `String?` | Customization               | Additional metadata used for Echo Squad operations.                             |
| `isConversation`              | `bool`    | Threaded command context    | Enables structured, multi-turn conversational commands.                         |
| `selectedConversationMembers` | `String?` | User targeting              | Used to apply commands only to specific members.                                |
| `fromDate`                    | `String?` | Temporal filters            | Filter commands to a date range context.                                        |
| `toDate`                      | `String?` | Temporal filters            | Filter commands to a date range context.                                        |
| `streamId`                    | `String?` | Stream-specific behavior    | Route or scope commands to a particular content stream.                         |

###### üìù Note:
If you add or modify any custom parameters in the `sendTextEvent` function (e.g., to support new features or command behaviours), you must also update the following:
1. `parseAndRunCommand` method in `room.dart`
2. `CommandArgs` class in `commands_extension.dart`

This ensures consistency and proper handling of command arguments across the system.

This ensures consistency in how command arguments are parsed and handled across the system, especially for custom flags like `isEchoChamber`, `streamId`, or `isImageModeEnable`.

# Matrix SDK

Matrix (matrix.org) SDK written in dart.

## Native libraries

For E2EE, vodozemac must be provided.

Additionally, OpenSSL (libcrypto) must be provided on native platforms for E2EE.

For flutter apps you can easily import it with the [flutter_vodozemac](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_vodozemac) and the [flutter_openssl_crypto](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_openssl_crypto) packages.

```sh
flutter pub add matrix

# Optional: For end to end encryption:
flutter pub add flutter_vodozemac
flutter pub add flutter_openssl_crypto
```

## Get started

See the API documentation for details:

[API documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/matrix/latest/)

### Tests

```shell
thread_count=$(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN) // or your favourite number :3
dart test --concurrency=$thread_count test
```

- Adding the `-x olm` flag will skip tests which require olm
- Using `-t olm` will run only olm specific tests, but these will probably break as they need prior setup (which is not marked as olm and hence won't be run)
